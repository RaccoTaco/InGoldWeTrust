# InGoldWeTrust
Project for SE

Simple project for SE using Java. Could be improved; lacked a way to grab WoW's item imagery - would have preferred an API or grabbing the image link from an HTML tag, but neither was possible. Used a screencap library and cropped the image based on location and colors of the screencap using python instead.
